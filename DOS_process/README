Brief Description: The scripts, i.e. SplitDos.sh, Process_Partial_Dos.py, Read_File.py and main.py can
                   coded to facilitate the post-process of the partial DOS calculation using VASP:

                        1. SplitDos.sh can split a DOSCAR into a series of sub-DOS files for each atom with
                           filenames 'DOS + the atom index in the POSCAR', i.e. DOS001, DOS101, ... And the
                           the size of the atom index shown in the filename is equal to that of the number of
                           atoms in the DOSCAR
                           >>>Note that the first and the last lines of the split DOS file for each are
                              the separator which separates the partial DOS of each atom in the overall DOSCAR.
                              Between the two lines are the real partial DOS for each atom.<<<
                        2. Process_Partial_Dos.py with another bash script named SplitDos.sh is coded for the
                           post-process of a partial DOS calculation using VASP when the manipulation (i.e.
                           ***DOS combination or subtraction,
                           ***total (spin-polarized) DOS calculation,
                           ***fermi energy correction)
                           of the (spin-polarized) DOSs of specific atoms in a crystal system is required.
                        3. Read_File.py can read partial DOS files that derive from SplitDos.sh and format the
                           DOS which can be used the input DOS data of class 'DOS' in Process_Partial_Dos.py.
                           On the other hand, it can extract certain params bellow from a setting, which defines
                           the DOS manipulations. You can look at Process_Partial_Dos.py or main.py to figure out
                           the function of this script.
                        4. main.py is the main script coded in Python. This script imports Process_Partial_Dos.py
                           and Read_File.py as modules and processes DOS according to the DOS manipulation specified
                           in a setting file, say setting.

How to use:
          step 1. Use SplitDos.sh to split a DOSCAR into a series of sub-DOS files for each atom with
                  filenames 'DOS + the atom index in the POSCAR', i.e. DOS001, DOS101, ...
                  command: >>>. SplitDos.sh

          step 2. In order to provide what DOS manipulations are supposed to be made, you need to provide a setting file,
                  say named 'setting'. In this file, each line is a individual job. The partial DOS manipulations of the
                  specified atoms will be implemented and written into a file as per parameters bellow.
                  Parameters required:
                                - ISPIN=1 | 2: (optional, default: 1)
                                             whether it is a spin-polarized calculation: set "ISPIN=2" if it is; otherwise "ISPIN=1".
                                - ATOMS= indice (i.e. 1,4,102,205): (Must be set)
                                             List the atom indice as in the POSCAR.
                                             The indice are ONLY separated by a comma. Whitespaces and tabs are not allowed.
                                - MAX_INDEX=len(atom_index) : (Must be set)
                                             The maximum atom index
                                - OPERATION=COM | SUB: (optional, default: COM)
                                                              If COM, DOS combination calculation is made ;
                                                              If SUB, DOS subtraction calculation is made;
                                - SUM_DOS= TRUE | FALSE: (optional, default: FALSE)
                                                              If TRUE and ISPIN=2, the total spin polarized DOSs are calculated:
                                                                      1st col, 2nd col, 3rd col: energy, spin up DOS, spin down DOS
                                                              If TRUE, the total DOS is calculated: 1st col, 2nd col: energy, total DOS
                                                              If FALSE, no action
                                - FERMI_ENERGY: (optional, default: 0)
                                                              Reset energy with respect to FERMI_ENERGY
                                - FILENAME= e.g setting_file: (optional, default: output_dos)
                                             Give a filename which you want to store the calculated DOS
                                             AFTER ALL DOS MANIPULATIONS. --->This filename will be formated into lower cases.
                  ***The three paramters should be separted by whitespaces or tabs
                  ***The parameters could be in either the lower case or the upper case
